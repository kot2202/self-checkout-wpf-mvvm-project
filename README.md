## ‚öô How to run the program locally
‚ö† Design view may not render if visual studio version is lower than 2019 16.6 and the option `Use the preview Windows Forms designer for .NET Core apps` is disabled.<br /><br />
‚ùó By default bill printing works by printing to .pdf file in PrintOuts folder located in `bin/Debug` or `bin/Release` this may ‚ùó NOT work if you do not have `Microsoft Print to PDF` Printer installed. Edit `Config/Receipt.cs` PrinterName and disable `PrintToFile` or install `Microsoft Print to PDF` if that is the case.
1. Create DB named `Store` and SQL Tables - [(SQL_CreateTable.txt)](SQL_CreateTable.txt)

3. Clone this repository
4. Run the project file, right click the solution and rebuild it
5. Switch the configuration from `Debug` to `Release` to run the program in fullscreen as intended without any extra controls that could create security breach
